                  Everyone needs a health check-up, no matter how healthy an individual is. 
                  The most common causes of premature death in the world are due to heart, lung, bowel, 
                  kidney disease and cancer. Early detection is an important form of disease prevention. 
                  Getting a check-up periodically is a good step to staying healthy always. 
                  It is recommended to have a health check-up at an early age for those with a family 
                  history of diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol or heart disease and also for 
                  individuals who have a smoking habit or with any of the health risk behaviors.

                  carefully by our physicians and necessary advice would be provided to improve these.
